# 3DShapeExplorer

## Theme

3D Shape Explorer

## Objective

Build an interactive C# application that allows users to visualize 3D primitives and apply basic geometric transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling in real time.

## Description

3DShapeExplorer is an application that allows users to explore and visualize three-dimensional geometric shapes. The application includes at least five 3D primitives: cube, sphere, cone, cylinder, and pyramid. Users can apply basic geometric transformations using keyboard keys to dynamically modify the position, orientation, and size of the shapes.

### Features

* **3D Primitive Visualization**: Displays geometric shapes in an interactive 3D environment.
* **Geometric Transformations**:

  * **Translation**: Move the shapes along the X, Y, and Z axes using the "J", "L", "I", "K", "U", and "O" keys.
  * **Rotation**: Rotate the shapes around the X, Y, and Z axes using the "NumPad4", "NumPad6", "NumPad8", "NumPad2", "A", and "D" keys.
  * **Scaling**: Uniformly change the size of the shapes using the "W" and "S" keys.
* **Keyboard Controls**: Use keyboard keys to apply real-time transformations.

### Operating Modes

The application includes two operating modes:

1. **Object Mode**: In this mode, users can select a 3D shape and apply transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling.
2. **Edition Mode**: In this mode, users can edit and delete 3D shapes in the environment.

## Requirements

* .NET 5.0 or higher
* A development environment compatible with C# (e.g., Visual Studio)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sebas-Parra/3DShapeExplorer.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Restore the required NuGet packages.
4. Build and run the application.

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Use keyboard keys to apply the desired transformations:

   * Translation: "J", "L", "I", "K", "U", "O"
   * Rotation: "NumPad4", "NumPad6", "NumPad8", "NumPad2", "A", "D"
   * Scaling: "W", "S"
3. Observe how the shapes change in real time.

## Example Shapes

* Cube
* Cylinder
* Dodecagonal Prism
* Octahedron
* Pyramid
